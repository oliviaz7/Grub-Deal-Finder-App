## Communication and Meetings

- Our team will use a Discord group chat to communicate project-related matters.

- All members will attend these meetings or notify the team in advance of anticipated absences. We all agree that absences should be rare.
- All group members will come to the meetings prepared by:
    - reading the assigned material (as much as possible), and
    - coming with ideas pretaining to the tasks and decisions to be made.
    - Questions or description of roadblocks they may have
- Members will not work on other assignments during meetings and will be engaged.
- Decisions can be made during meetings even some members are absent.
- Each member will take turns listening as well as talking, and active listening will be a strategy for all group discussions. To facilitate conversation, the conversation will start with the team lead and rotate clockwise from their position.

- Grace will take notes during all meetings and post them on GitHub Wiki within 1 day.
